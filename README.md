PROJECT:
WEATHER MONITORING STATION.

OVERVIEW:
Global warming has lead to unpredictable climates; researchers around the world are using weather stations to observe record and analyze weather patterns to study climate changes and provide weather forecasts. These Weather stations normally comprise of few sensors to measure environmental parameters and a monitoring or logging system to analyze these parameters. In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a wireless IoT-based weather station that can measure critical environmental parameters like Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure.

Components Required:
1.Arduino Uno
2.ESP8266 Wi-Fi Shield
3.DHT11 Sensor
4.BMP180 Sensor
5.Breadboard
6.Jumper Wires

Why we need an IoT based weather monitoring system?

Ease of monitoring your local weather conditions in real time from anywhere in the world.
For storing weather and environment data for short and long term for studying weather pattern changes and to understand how human induced climate change affected your local weather.
Easy deployment of the setup for monitoring local atmospheric conditions and microclimates for weather forecasting and prediction.

Types of sensors involved in weather monitoring:

Temperature sensor.
Humidity / hygrometer sensor.
Soil moisture sensor.
Rain sensor etc.

DHT11 is a digital sensor responsible for collecting temperature and humidity data from your surroundings. It has three terminals namely:

Vcc
GND
